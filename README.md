My TypeScript + MUI Account Management
This is a front-end only account management application built with TypeScript and Material-UI. It provides two functionalities:

Create a new account
Log in to an existing account
This front-end does not have an integrated back-end for authentication, user management, and storage. The API fetches are only for demonstration purposes.

You need to have your own back-end for user registration, authentication, and account management.
